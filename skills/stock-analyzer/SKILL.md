## Workflow

When a user requests stock analysis, follow this workflow:

### Setup
There should be a venv already in the skill folder. Use the python binary from there.
Claude folder (to be called `CLAUDIR`) -- default to `~/.claude`
Skill folder -- likely `skills/stock-analyzer/`
Venv -- Likely `.venv`

Python binary `{CLAUDIR}/skills/stock-analyzer/.venv/bin/python3`

I'll refer to that as `{PYBIN}`

The scripts folder is `{CLAUDIR}/skills/stock-analyzer/scripts` now `{SCRIPTDIR}`

### 1. Identify Analysis Type

**Basic price queries:**
- "What's AAPL trading at?" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL`
- "Show me Tesla's price" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker TSLA`

**Technical analysis queries:**
- "Is AAPL overbought?" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL --technical`
- "Analyze TSLA with technical indicators" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker TSLA --technical`
- "Should I buy MSFT?" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker MSFT --technical`

**Chart generation queries:**
- "Show me a chart of AAPL" → Run script with chart option, display the image from `data['chart']` field
- "Chart for NVDA" → Generate candlestick chart and embed using `![Chart](<path>)`

**Sentiment analysis queries:**
- "What is the sentiment for Tesla?" → Run script and report `data['news_sentiment']` values
- "How is the news for NVDA?" → Analyze sentiment scores and describe market mood

**Historical data queries:**
- "Show me AAPL's 6-month trend" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL --period 6mo --technical`

**Multi-market queries:**
- "Analyze Tencent stock" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker 0700.HK --technical`
- "How is Moutai performing?" → Run: `{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker 600519.SS --technical`

### 2. Parse JSON Output

The script returns structured JSON with the following format:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "market": "us",
    "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:30:00Z",
    "currency": "USD",
    "cached": false
  },
  "price": {
    "current": 185.23,
    "change": 0.73,
    "change_pct": 0.40,
    "open": 184.50,
    "high": 186.00,
    "low": 183.75,
    "volume": 52341000
  },
  "technical": {
    "indicators": {
      "rsi_14": 62.5,
      "macd": {"macd": 2.34, "signal": 1.89, "histogram": 0.45},
      "bb_upper": 190.50,
      "bb_middle": 185.00,
      "bb_lower": 179.50,
      "sma_20": 183.20,
      "sma_50": 182.34,
      "sma_200": 175.67
    },
    "signals": {
      "rsi_signal": "neutral",
      "macd_signal": "bullish",
      "bb_signal": "normal",
      "trend": "uptrend",
      "recommendation": "buy"
    }
  },
  "chart": "/path/to/chart.png",
  "news_sentiment": {
    "average_polarity": 0.45,
    "average_subjectivity": 0.62,
    "headlines": [...]
  },
  "history": [...]
}
```

### 3. Provide Analysis

Based on the data returned:

**For price-only queries:**
- State current price, change, and change percentage
- Mention if data is cached (check metadata.cached)

**For technical analysis queries:**
- Interpret key indicators relevant to the question
- Explain what the signals mean
- Provide the overall recommendation
- Support your analysis with specific indicator values

**For chart queries:**
- **Display the chart**: The JSON output includes a `"chart"` field with a file path. **You must display this image** to the user using markdown: `![Chart](<path>)`
- Describe key visual patterns visible in the chart

**For sentiment queries:**
- Use the values in `"news_sentiment"` to describe market mood
- Report average polarity and subjectivity
- Mention key headlines if relevant

**Example interpretation:**
```
User: "Is AAPL overbought right now?"

[After running the command and getting JSON output]

Response: "Apple (AAPL) is currently trading at $185.23, up 0.40% today. Based on technical analysis:

- RSI is at 62.5, which is in neutral territory (not overbought). Overbought would be above 70.
- The price is near the middle Bollinger Band at $185.00, suggesting normal volatility.
- MACD shows a bullish signal with a positive histogram of 0.45.
- The stock is in an uptrend, trading above its 50-day SMA of $182.34.

Overall recommendation: BUY. The stock shows bullish momentum without being overextended."
```

### 4. Multi-Market Support

The skill automatically detects the market from the ticker format:

- **US Stocks**: Use standard ticker (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
- **Hong Kong Stocks**: Use .HK suffix (0700.HK for Tencent, 9988.HK for Alibaba)
- **China A-Shares**:
  - Shanghai: .SS suffix (600519.SS for Moutai)
  - Shenzhen: .SZ suffix (000001.SZ for Ping An Bank)

The system automatically adjusts timezone and currency based on the market.

## Command Options

```bash
# Basic price check
{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL

# Technical analysis
{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL --technical

# Custom time period (1mo, 6mo, 1y, max)
{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL --period 3mo --technical

# Custom interval (1d, 1wk, 1mo)
{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL --period 6mo --interval 1d

# Disable caching (force fresh data)
{PYBIN} {SCRIPTDIR}/main.py --ticker AAPL --technical --no-cache
```

## Important Notes

2. **Check for errors** - If the JSON contains an `error` field, explain the error to the user
3. **Cache awareness** - Mention if data is cached (metadata.cached = true) when relevant
4. **Market context** - Include market name and currency in your response
5. **Be specific** - Cite actual indicator values from the JSON, don't make up numbers
6. **Explain signals** - Don't just state "RSI is 62.5", explain what that means ("RSI at 62.5 indicates neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold")
7. **Display charts** - When chart data is available, always embed the image in your response
8. **Report sentiment** - Include news sentiment analysis when available in the data

## Error Handling

If the command fails or returns an error:
1. Check the error message in the JSON output
2. Common issues:
   - Invalid ticker symbol
   - Market closed (recent data may not be available)
   - API rate limits (try again with --no-cache)
   - Network issues
3. Explain the error clearly to the user
4. Suggest alternatives if possible

## Data Sources

- **Primary**: yfinance library (Yahoo Finance data)
- **Fallback**: Direct Yahoo Finance API
- **Cache**: Local file-based cache (15-minute TTL)

## Limitations

- Real-time data has ~15-minute delay for free tier
- Some indicators require minimum data history (e.g., 200-day SMA needs 200 days)
- Market-specific data availability varies (US > HK > CN A-shares)
- Technical analysis is based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance
